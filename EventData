Though separated by mere blocks, their realities are worlds apart. Nowhere is this clearer than in each community's response to possible links between the company's activities and the townspeople's illnesses. African-American residents who believe pollution is increasing as their health goes downhill demand to be relocated, led by the indefatigable Margie Richard. The white neighborhoods, largely home to employees of Shell Industries, see no problems, and neither does the company. A modern David and Goliath story, Fenceline shows how one small community and one big corporation struggle to come to terms." The film will be followed by a discussion hosted by Environmentalists of Color, Organize!

The white neighborhoods, largely home to employees of Shell Industries, see no problems, and neither does the company. A modern David and Goliath story, Fenceline shows how one small community and one big corporation struggle to come to terms." The film will be followed by a discussion hosted by Environmentalists of Color, Organize!

KD and SAS present Valentine's Day PUB
Start	Feb. 12, 2014, 9 p.m.
Location	Dom's Lounge
Description	The gentlemen of Kappa Delta and the ladies of the Scripps Associated Students cordially invite you to attend Valentine’s Day PUB. I must inform you that KD and SAS have not collaborated since the Animal Party four years ago. That party is often hailed in party lore as the greatest party the 5C’s has ever had. The great Fred Sontag, and I quote, called it “Legendary.” This is as big of a deal as the Beatles coming to the US, Michael Jackson releasing Thriller, or the return of Justin Timberlake to POP music. 

We are expecting an enormous turnout for this event; thus, we have decided that our usual two kegs will not be sufficient. SAS and KD will be providing two cases of wine in addition to two kegs of delicious Rolling Rock for those of you that are 21. We will also be replacing our normal Cheetos and Doritos with the much more palatable cheese and crackers. If you are distraught about us not offering your favorite cheap chips, please email your comments and complaints to arash.mahboubi@pomona.edu. Please no hate mail, he’s very sensitive. 

For one time only, PUB will open its doors at 9:00 for all members of the 5C’s. We will also be opening up the patio to provide more space. Dom’s Lounge will be completely decorated in the spirit of Valentine’s Day. Be sure to show up at 9:00 to sip wine, eat cheese and crackers, and socialize. Around 10:45, dancing will commence. The highly respected DJ trifecta from Scripps, Allison, Hanna and Ishmam, will take the stage providing the greatest beats your ears have ever heard. This will be the classiest PUB ever. Please dress to impress, semi-formal is perfect. 

Summary: 
Wine, Beer, Cheese, Crackers, Semi-formal, Decorations, Allison Riegle, Ishmam Rahman, Hanna Brody, SAS, KD. 

“Don’t cry because it’s over, smile because it happened” 
- KD and SAS.

Travis Horton, "Facilitating Well-Being Through Environmental Analysis"
Start	Feb. 13, 2014, 4:15 p.m.
End	Feb. 14, 2014, 5:30 p.m.
Location	PO-Edmunds 114
Description	Just about everything we do is an attempt to improve our well-being, argues Travis Horton of the University of Canterbury (Christchurch NZ). We eat, drink and breathe to maintain our health. We think to solve problems and evaluate consequences. We interact to learn, engage and express. The paradox is that one person’s pursuit of well-being has the potential to hinder another’s - often through indirect and unintended flow-on effects. For example, intensification of land-use practices might produce more food (and revenue), but it might also pollute drinking water downstream. Perhaps the greatest challenge of our time is finding a balanced and sustainable approach to the pursuit of well-being. He will present examples of how we can use stable isotopes to trace interacting Earth system processes and conditions with a focus on issues surrounding global food supply, water resources and development of geothermal energy sources; he'll also discuss the utility of research- informed undergraduate learning as a means of achieving balanced and sustainable solutions to the pursuit of well-being from an Earth Systems perspective.

So come down to Dom's with your "Back to Back World War Champs" tanks, and your red, white, and blue donned in anticipation of a phenomenal night of drinking America's favorite beverage, Nattie Light. 

Some people might wonder, "why are we celebrating America in the middle of February, don't we celebrate on July fourth?", but the real question is, "why don't we celebrate America every day, instead of just on July fourth?" To them I say, we can celebrate America every day.

Remember that you need to be 21 to drink, unless you are drinking our fine brand-name alternative sodas. We will also be providing chips just in case you miss snack. So bring your pick-up trucks, yodeling and blind patriotism to Dom's at 10:00 to celebrate the world's greatest country, and the one that you live in. See you all there!

Gaming the Humanities with Patrick Jagoda
Start	Feb. 20, 2014, 4:15 p.m.
Location	Ena Thompson Room, Crookshank Hall 108
Description	~*~*~*GAMES & TEA & SNACKS!~*~*~*

Games — through their mechanics, procedurality, navigable worlds, and multimedia interactions — call for new literacies that exceed traditional reading and writing skills. Digital games demand new ways of perceiving and working. They seem to matter to the unfolding of everyday life in the early twenty-first century, even if we do not yet always recognize precisely how they matter. 

Pomona alum Patrick Jagoda ('04) will be discussing his work with the Game Changer Chicago Design Lab, which works with high school students to develop video games that explore numerous educational topics.

An Assistant Professor of English and Media Studies at the University of Chicago, Jagoda is working to unite established literary traditions with new media.

**An English Department Tea will follow the presentation, which will include time to talk with Professor Jagoda.

See you there!

No Impact Week
Start	Feb. 23, 2014, 7 p.m.
End	March 2, 2014, 11:30 p.m.
Location	Pomona College
Description	"Are we as happy as we could be, living in a system based on the idea that people are best served by ever-increasing spending and material and energy use? Might we not be happier if our system emphasized health, happiness, and security?" asks No Impact Project founder, Colin Beavan.

Pledge to join the challenge here!: http://noimpactproject.org/2013/01/university/

No Impact Week is a one-week carbon cleanse that allows participants to experience the difference lowering their impact can have on their quality of life, their community, and their planet. The No Impact experience is about discovering how living a more environmentally friendly lifestyle can increase personal fulfillment, health, happiness, and time with family and friends. Beginning Sunday, 2/23, participants will work through a series of eight daily challenges, from decreasing trash production and home energy use, to eating locally and sustainably. The week will wrap up with a day of Eco-Sabbath on 3/2.

No Impact Week is not about telling people to deprive themselves and have less, but to replace the destructive behaviors that are ruining our environment with behavior that's better for both people and the planet.

More information on specific events to follow!

An educational institution or establishment, in particular. I know many of you are at the college of your dreams, but feel free to support your 2nd, 3rd or even last choice school. If you got the gear get here! Come drink beer like the rest of your "of age" peers and those in similar situations across the globe (unlike some others though, this is free for you). Have a great time wearing, or not wearing, a shirt, tank top, hat, sweatshirt, or underwear with the name of the your favorite college, or the college you hate most, whatever floats your metaphorical boat. We hope to see, or not see, you there... the choice is yours!

Refreshments and chips (obviously only the classiest most name brand expensive ones we can find) will be available for those not 21. Feel free to send any song that has gotten you off the books and into your dopest dougie to arash.mahboubi@pomona.edu. We ask you to please only send him song requests you are serious about, as we make him listen to every song in its entirety. 

See you, or not, Wednesday.

Free Choices, Free Speech: The Constitutionality of Abortion Clinic Buffer Zones
Start	March 4, 2014, 7 p.m.
End	March 4, 2014, 8:30 p.m.
Location	Rose Hills Theatre, Pomona College
Description	Ever since Roe v. Wade, activists on both sides of the abortion debate have battled each other in a range of forums, most publicly in front of reproductive health care facilities. This January, the Supreme Court heard arguments in McCullen v. Coakley, a case contesting the constitutionality of a Massachusetts law imposing a 35-foot fixed buffer zone around abortion clinics. Proponents of the law argue that buffer zones promote public safety, while opponents of the law claim that it infringes upon the freedom of speech of the protestors. Come join the PSU for a discussion of the constitutionality of buffer zones, free speech, and the current state of abortion politics.

Speakers: 

Loretta Ross is a founder of the SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Health Collective and was the National Co-Director of the April 25, 2004 March for Women’s Lives in Washington D.C.

Carrie Severino is chief counsel and policy director of the Judicial Crisis Network.

She also filed an amicus brief in support of the petitioners in McCullen v. Coakley.

Joshua Wilson is a Professor of Political Science at the University of Denver. His research focuses on the varying abilities of political and social movements to use the law in pursuit of political ends. He is the author of The Street Politics of Abortion: Speech, Violence, and America’s Culture Wars.

Description	Copying the Truth: Original, Copy, and Interpretation in the Live Arts
An Afternoon with Takao Kawaguchi

Takao Kawaguchi¹s career powerfully cuts across performance arts, political questions around desire and fantasy, and explorations in bodily movement and its limits. In addition to his twelve years as a member of ³dumb type,² one of Japan¹s leading performance groups, Mr. Kawaguchi¹s solo career has meant stage appearances on four continents. His recent work incorporates dance history and dance archives into very personal explorations of body, truth, and their imitations. An accomplished translator, Mr. Kawaguchi also worked for numerous years as director of the Tokyo International Lesbian & Gay Film Festival.

Wednesday, March 5, 1:15 to 4:00 p.m. 
(in two journeys)
Pomona College Museum of Art, Main Gallery
You are invited to attend one or both journeys with Mr. Kawaguchi.

Journey One: Good Luck: A Journey to Zero Velocity
1:15 to 2:30 p.m. Mr. Kawaguchi engages his audience in Good Luck, a dance performance. 

Journey Two: From Digital Image Machine to the Soul of Dance 
2:45 to 4:00 p.m. Mr. Kawaguchi leads us from his work in cutting-edge media performance group dumb type to his current archival performances in conversation with Japan¹s postwar butoh movement.

Mr. Kawaguchi¹s visit is supported by the Pomona College Museum of Art, Pomona College Dean¹s Office, and the Departments of Asian Languages & Literature and Media Studies. Photo of Mr. Kawaguchi by Teijiro Kamiyama. For more information, please contact: Jonathan Hall at jmhall@pomona.edu

Kappa Delta presents Workout Power Hour PUB
Start	March 5, 2014, 9:20 p.m.
Location	Doms lounge
Description	I’d like to begin this event invitation with an anecdotal story that will hopefully educate all of you as to why we chose the theme we did. The other day, I was in the middle of a grueling session of eight-minute abs when our president, Nick Sbardellati, came over and reprimanded me for working on my abs for only eight minutes. As he lifted up his shirt to show a chiseled physique even Michelangelo would be proud of, he said, “Why would you only work on your most important muscle group for eight minutes? I normally do it for an hour.” “An hour?!” I exclaim. “Like a power... hour?” “Yes, a power hour,” replied our fraternity’s great leader. Thus, the gentlemen of Kappa Delta cordially invite you to come celebrate Workout Power Hour PUB. 

For this PUB only, doors will open for the general population at 9:20 to allow for ample set up time for those of you interested in participating in the power hour. Beer will be provided for those of you over 21, and chips will be provided for those of you with the drunchies. The power hour will start precisely at 9:30 and go until 10:30 (its no coincidence the power hour lasts one hour). Wear workout clothes and come ready to celebrate working out, power hours, and the great friendships you’ve created in your time here at the Claremont Colleges. Hope to see you all there!

Location	Walker Lounge
Description	Dear Juniors,

Are you missing your friends abroad? 

Do you wish there was an easy way you could connect with your favorite Sagehens who aren't in Claremont this semester? 

Well luckily there is a solution to this growing dilemma – come to the Postcard Night Event this Thursday in Walker Lounge from 8 – 10 pm. The Junior Class Committee is providing a variety of postcards for the event, covering all postage fees and preparing a myriad of baked good and Trader Joe refreshments to snack on as you write to your faraway friends.

The Postcard Night Event that was held last semester was a huge success with over 110 postcards being sent out to Sagehens all over the world. Let’s keep that momentum rolling this Thursday as we aim to help keep the Class of 2015 united despite some small geographical differences. 

All years are welcome to join in on this study break providing some of our best friends with the best gift a broke college kid can send – a handwritten postcard! 

Looking forward to seeing you all there this Thursday night!

Love,
The Junior Class Committee

Moral Relativism Today: Personal Experience and Universal Morality
Start	March 7, 2014, 6:30 p.m.
End	March 7, 2014, 7:45 p.m.
Location	Doms Lounge, Smith Campus Center, Pomona College
Description	In recent years, France has often erupted in protest over proposed burqa bans, Denmark has banned the ancient practice of male circumcision, and in our own neuroscience classes students debate the ethicality of deaf parents selecting genes to have deaf children. In cases like these, where the conflict is often between two different cultures and their own moral codes, how do we decide whose morality is better? Is it cultural imperialism to rule a cultural practice is immoral? CAN we even decide if certain individuals have better moral intuitions than others?

Join the PSU as we debate the key question at the heart of these issues: the relationship between Personal Experience and Universal Morality.

Featuring:
Martin Kavka, Professor of Religious Studies at LeHigh University
C.C. Pecknold, Professor of Theology at Catholic University of America

"Happiness at Pomona" - Panel and Discussion
Start	March 7, 2014, 7 p.m.
End	March 7, 2014, 8 p.m.
Location	Smith Campus Center 201 (Hart Room)
Description	Pomona has repeatedly been ranked among the happiest colleges in the country, but what does that mean for students on a day-to-day basis? How does the Pomona community define “happiness,” and what impact does that have on campus culture?

The 5C Mental Health Alliance is proud to host a panel of student speakers to discuss how Pomona’s administration perceives and promotes “happiness”, how they themselves have found fulfillment during their time at Pomona, and their thoughts on what Stanford has coined the “duck syndrome”—the phenomenon in which students seem to be gliding smoothly along, but are paddling frantically beneath the surface.

In providing a forum for students to share their perspectives on these topics, we hope to encourage thoughtful discussion about mental well-being on campus and increase students’ satisfaction with the Pomona community.

Kappa Delta presents PowerDown Spring Break Beach PUB
Start	March 26, 2014, 9:45 p.m.
End	March 27, 2014, midnight
Location	Doms Lounge
Description	The gentlemen of Kappa Delta cordially invite you to celebrate PowerDown Spring Break Beach PUB with us. At KD we like to give you more bang for your buck, so we’ve graciously decided to have a three themed PUB. Come to Doms Lounge wearing an outfit characteristic of your spring break or your finest beach attire. Since I hiked the lost coast, toured a brewery, and swam in a lake, I’ll be wearing my hiking boots, my Coors Banquet Beer baseball cap, and my swimsuit. 

History will be made when DJ Ski spins his eargasming beats using solar power. SolTrain, the 1 KW solar power array outside of Doms Lounge, will be providing power to the lights, speakers, and most importantly our wine cooler. PowerDown PUB will be the kick-off event of the 5C PowerDown Week, hosted by sustainability groups at the 5C’s. Since we are in a drought, we urge you to do your part and save water by showering together, not watering your lawns, and making love with the lights off. 

We will provide two kegs of natural light, or the next cheapest beer Liquor Land has available. We will also provide 15 bags of cheap, gross chips and one bag of delicious Kettle Chips. General admittance begins at 9:45. It is common knowledge that the D’s throw the best Wednesday night party on the 5C’s, and this week’s party will certainly live up to the hype. Much love to all of our loyal PUB goers, and hopefully we’ll see some new faces there this week! 

“Love is an irresistible desire to be irresistibly desired.”

We will look at how the social landscape of the nation-state is shifting through changes in population and infrastructure; at the ways in which Africa can invest in Africa; at the ways in which we forge connections across boundaries; at how our leadership influences the trajectory of growth and at how our health challenges require a global, holistic outlook to provide solutions. We will move beyond dissension and conflict in order to renew our commitment to peace, to development and, most importantly, to unity. 

This year’s conference will feature distinguished speakers including Nobel Peace Prize Laureate, Leymah Gbowee; and Ladi Delano, CEO of Bakrie Delano Africa and one of Forbes' "Ten Young African Millionaires To Watch" in 2012. 

The conference will feature five discussion panels concerning infrastructure, economic development, telecommunications,governance, and global health as well as a series of breakout sessions regarding regional integration, African art and literature, education and LGBTQ rights.

Kappa Delta Presents: Jersey PUB
Start	April 9, 2014, 9:45 p.m.
End	April 10, 2014, midnight
Location	Doms Lounge
Description	The gentlemen of Kappa Delta cordially invite you to come revel in all that is sport, spirit, and general debauchery this Wednesday night at Jersey PUB. With March Madness coming to a close, baseball season kicking off, NBA playoffs looming on the horizon, and (most importantly, of course) MLS season in full swing, there is no better time than now to rep your favorite team or player's jersey. Come join us in getting so inebriated that you believe you are capable of feats of athleticism comparable to those attributed to the name on the back of your jersey (KD does not condone PUB posterizing, but we'd probably enjoy watching you try).

If you aren't a sports person, but still love to party, not to worry! We invite you to remember that "jersey" could refer to any number of garments in which mildly athletic activity is performed. Alternatively, you could take a more creative approach and go with a "Shore" tacked on to the end, and show up with nothing on but your spray tan - Gym Tan Laundry baby. 

As always, we will be providing two kegs of the most delicious beer that 90 bucks can buy, as well as the finest knock-off brands of chips and soda available in the WalMart clearance aisle. KD reminds you to always respect the right of others to dance alone and with friends, and further reminds you that if you choose to be a creep we will choose to boot your ass right out the front door. If you see any behavior of this sort please contact a member of KD or Campus Security immediately. 

And finally some food for thought. The dictionary.com definition of Jersey: "One of a breed of dairy cattle, raised originally on the island of Jersey, producing milk with a high butterfat content." The costume potentials are endless.

"Party on Garth."

South Campus Events presents *~SURFBOARDT~* on Friday night, April 11th in the SCC Social Room from 10:30pm to 1 am.

Why SURFBOARDT? Well, who's best at topping the charts with music that makes you feel flawless/sexy/cool and want to drop it low? If you're not part of the Beyhive, don't be discouraged. SURFBOARDT will be a bumpin' dance party featuring all of your favorite artists, hits, throwbacks, and remixes. If Queen B isn't your style, best believe that you'll find a taste of what you're looking for at some point during the night.

You can make song suggestions here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1qSWN1bGSPSlzCfNGROVEL6iBAU2beAzEl9kHl8jpFRE/viewform

There will be snacks, light refreshments (unfortunately no watermelon), and tons of fun. 

We hope to see you there!

*If you will be hosting a prospective student, make sure to get a visitors pass from the building manager at the SCC before the party! We don't want anyone getting left behind.

**PEC and South Campus Events are large supporters of safe party spaces and a consent-based campus climate. Incidents and behaviors that do not encourage a safe space will not be tolerated.

***SURFBOARDT PT. 2 will be at Pendleton Pool on Saturday, April 19th from 1pm-4pm. Take a dip in the pool and continue the themed celebration with us! Snacks and music provided.

****Make sure to go to BASHMENT on Saturday, April 12th from 10pm-1am sponsored by PASA!

*****Invite your friends!

Sanskriti 2014
Start	April 12, 2014, 7 p.m.
Location	Bridges Auditorium - Pomona College
Description	SNEAK PEEK #3: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPdMMY0tYJE

There are moments in our lives when we are lost. When we stand at a precipice, lost in our thoughts, directionless, staring into the monolithic vastness of stagnant skies. Time passes, and the hues of blue give way to darkness—darkness soon to be punctured by splatters of light. This light does little. We still seek answers. We still yearn for direction. We keep staring. From one splatter to the next, and all of the nothingness in between. We are lost. 

There are moments in our lives when we glimpse greatness. We stand at a precipice, lost in our thoughts, directionless, starting into the monolithic vastness of stagnant skies. And then we see it. We see the light, the comet of splendor fearlessly carving its path out of the splattered celestial landscape. And in this moment, we have clarity. The emptiness inside escapes us and dissolves into the surrounding atmosphere. In this moment, the questions inside escape us, and dissolve into the surrounding atmosphere. In this moment, our frustrations give way to other sensations. Patience, has gotten us here. And in this moment, we have clarity. We have direction. We are greatness. 

Patience has gotten us here. Claremont’s time has come. Now you ask, what is this comet that is slicing its way through our smoggy SoCal skies?

Sanskriti 2014? 
No. Well, maybe. 

This generously lengthed event description?
No. Well, maybe.

But Aunty? Yes. 

WHO IS THIS AUNTY? Yes, I read minds. A quick trick I picked up from @Albert_Chang (The magical man behind our promo videos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEIOqzRtKko ). Aunty is THE number one star from South Asia’s multi-billion dollar bollywood industry. She is no splatter, friends. She’s a painting.

List of some her lesser accomplishments:
*Solved the Energy Crisis.
*Got the Government of India to ban every overly-dramatic Bollywood Film
*Got Drake to get over his Ex. 
*Convinced NASA to allow her to replace Pluto as the 9th planet. 
* Took the SAT and broke it.
*Invented Pitzer Brunch.
*Won connect four in three moves.
*Convinced the Coop to stop charging for empty cups.
*Got North and South Dakota to come together as one.
*Cut through a knife with hot butter.

Aunty-Ji (the suffix ‘Ji’ demonstrates respect for Bollywood’s most beloved superstar) is gracing us with her presence on APRIL 12th at 7 pm in Big Bridges at SANSKRITI 2014, one of the largest student-organized events on the 5C campus. With Aunty-Ji’s blessings last year, SANSKRITI 2013 filled up over 900 seats. Out of respect for Aunty-Ji, Sanskriti’s sponsors: (Claremont EKTA, The Claremont Bollywood Dance Crew, and Pomona Events Committee (PEC)), will be providing free Indian food and drinks. Due to Aunty-Ji’s generous personal contribution, admission is free and you are invited to bring any friends, non-friends, family members, professors, and other members of our lovely Claremont Community. 

See you soon,
Aunty-Ji’s personal P.R. Agent
--
Peace. Love. Sanskriti.

*Some facts regarding Aunty-Ji may be slightly exaggerated to make her sound cool so you'll come to our show and eat our free food.

Doors open at 6:30 -- Refreshments served at 6:30

Kappa Delta presents Pajama PUB
Start	April 16, 2014, 9:45 p.m.
Location	Doms Lounge
Description	Hello party people! 

The gentlemen of Kappa Delta cordially invite you to join us as we celebrate Pajama PUB. I hate to be a Debbie Downer, but I must present to you all some terribly sad information. The greatest class of D’s this fraternity has ever had is graduating soon. Graduation, like spring, is the time of year when caterpillars burst through their cocoons and become butterflies. The seniors in Kappa Delta are caterpillars, soon to be butterflies, except for not as pretty (Ian is an exception). The Keck Science Institute has shown that caterpillars are not only more sociable than butterflies, but also have a higher alcohol tolerance. 

This information should serve as motivation for you to come on down to Doms and party with Nick, Peter, Sean, Bowers, Dylon, Riggins, Ian, Kyle, Michael, Weston, and yours truly. This is one of the last times of your life to party with some truly special people, so don’t pass up this opportunity and end up regretting this for the rest of your life. Trust me when I say that a class featuring Arash “My Boobies” Mahboubi and Nick “I Sometimes Party” Bougopolis will simply not be the same. 

Since I am a benevolent party thrower, I will give you people some more information about this risqué theme. The word pajama originally derives from the Persian word payjameh, and it was incorporated into the English language during the British Raj through the Hindustani language. Three types of pajamas exist today: traditional, contemporary, and daywear. Traditional pajamas consist of a jacket-and-trousers combination made of soft fabric, such as flannel. Contemporary pajamas are derived from traditional pajamas. There are many variations in style such as short sleeve pajamas, pajama bottoms of varying length, or, on occasion, one-piece pajamas, and pajamas incorporating various materials. Daywear pajamas may refer to women's combination daywear, consisting of short-sleeved or sleeveless blouses and lightweight trousers. Examples of these include capri-pajamas, beach pajamas, and hostess pajamas. This should be more than enough information for you to figure out how to dress for the theme. 

Hope to see you all there in your PJ’s! 

“It’s something unpredictable, but in the end that’s right, I hope you had the time of your life.”
- Kappa Delta

TAKE BACK THE NIGHT 2014
Start	April 24, 2014, 8 p.m.
Location	Marston Quad-Pomona College
Description	Please join us in a walk to create a safe space that shows survivors of sexual assault and sexual abuse that they are not alone. We plan to walk across the 5C campuses on the evening of Thursday, April 24th to demonstrate this support.

We cannot eliminate sexual violence without addressing the ways that it affects different communities. We recognize that people experience sexual violence very differently based on their race, class, sexuality, gender, location, etc. It is critical to engage these diverse groups in order to create a community where people feel empowered to stand together to denounce sexual violence. TOGETHER, LETS TAKE BACK THE NIGHT!

Unbelonging: A Film Series Part II - Cambodian Son
Start	April 30, 2014, 4 p.m.
Location	Rose Hills Theatre, Pomona College
Description	Thirty-five-year-old Kosal Khiev was forced to flee Cambodia to the United States as a 1-year-old refugee. Later forcibly returned to Phnom Penh as an exiled “criminal alien,” he is a volatile, charming and talented young poet whose life begins to change when he is invited to represent Cambodia at the London 2012 Cultural Olympiad.	
As an infant, Kosal was one of 280,000 Cambodian refugees granted asylum in the United States after fleeing massive US bombing campaigns and the Khmer Rouge genocide. Fully American in all but citizenship, Kosal and thousands of others received prison time for serious youthful mistakes and were punished again with deportation.
Kosal wrestles with the contradictions of being banned from home for life, making his way with his fellow exilees who face depression, substance abuse and suicide while finding new freedom as an international poet.

Screening of "Half of a Yellow Sun"
Start	May 5, 2014, 7:12 a.m.
End	May 5, 2014, 10:12 a.m.
Location	Women's Union
Description	Synopsis:
"Olanna (Thandie Newton) and Kainene (Anika Noni Rose) are glamorous twins from a wealthy Nigerian family. Upon returning to a privileged city life in newly independent 1960s Nigeria after their expensive English education, the two women make very different choices. Olanna shocks her family by going to live with her lover, the "revolutionary professor" Odenigbo (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and his devoted houseboy Ugwu (John Boyega) in the dusty university town of Nsukka; Kainene turns out to be a fiercely successful businesswoman when she takes over the family interests, and surprises even herself when she falls in love with Richard (Joseph Mawle), an English writer. Preoccupied by their romantic entanglements, and a betrayal between the sisters, the events of their life seem to loom larger than politics. However, they become caught up in the events of the Nigerian civil war, in which the lgbo people fought an impassioned struggle to establish Biafra as an independent republic, ending in chilling violence which shocked the entire world.

A sweeping romantic drama, HALF OF A YELLOW SUN takes the sisters and their lovers on a journey through the war which is powerful, intensely emotional and, as the response of readers around the world has shown, it is a story which can touch everyone’s heart".
